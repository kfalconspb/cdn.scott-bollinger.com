Vault training in AZ, Citrix Synergy in Orlando, and recently learning Amazon
Web Services. All this and 5 blog posts in draft. I decided to power on and not
get stuck in the log jam. I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll eventually finish the other posts but I
want to get things in motion again.

I&#x27;m having fun diving deeper on my favorite topics as well as learning new
things. Topics like Citrix NetScaler, AlienVault, and AWS.

It didn't fit into the way I study for exams. I was spending more time worrying about blogging the objectives and how it looked, than learning the topic.</p><p>On a more positive note, I studied for both NetScaler exams CCA-N and CCP-N leading up to Citrix Synergy. I didn't find them too difficult. Though, I usually over study in an extreme way.</p><p>AWS is the new toy in my toolbox so I'll probably write a couple posts on that and NetScaler in AWS.</p>
