When powering on virtual machines in my Hyper-V lab, all of them gave Error 3278
failed to change state of the VM.

They were working yesterday. All my drives working? What did I do? What changed?
 Yeah, 9 times out of 10 it&#x27;s the later.

What did I do?
I remembered working on vSwitches and seeing if I could figure out internal
vSwitch and maybe NATing in Hyper-V. Deleting, adding, re-configuring, could
that be it?

After that change they all powered on with no other errors.</p><p>This was a quick post, though a valuable lesson, either for the home lab or a production environment. "If it was working before...What changed?"</p><p>At least I learned something and I hope you enjoy in my misadventures.</p>
