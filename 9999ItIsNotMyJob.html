                    <p>Everyone has said or heard it at one time in their life. Tired, disgusted, maybe you're identified and reported the problem previously. What to do? 
                    The observation
                    At hair salon waiting room for wife in separate room with hair dresser. Two other stylists were had both just finished up appointments and were lounging in the chair at the station. I had notice they cleaned up their stations and the floor at the station. Both sitting there discussing the state of cleanliness of the salon as a whole. What caught my attention was when I heard one of them say that one of their earlier customers had empty the two public area trash cans. One located in the general area of the main floor of stations and another by the dirty coffee machine in the front lobby where I was located. They then said it wasn't my job and started complaining about someone I guess would be the manager or owner. 
                    Other industries
                    My mind started running on if this translates to IT and most likely we've all heard the phrase. Yes of course it does. But how does it manifest, how do the customers see it and would their perception of us was any different than mine observation at the salon.
                    As a customer it didn't matter to me who was responsible for cleaning, only in my experience while I waited and used the lobby to work from while the wife got cut and colored.
                    Noticing and attention 
                    Before we start the finger pointing process lets examine the flow of a problem. At some point you will notice or be notified of an issue or item that needs attentions. It could be a misconfiguration or something as simple as a incorrect naming standard. If you're the person that did it, fix it. Sure there might be change control or approval but own up everyone makes mistakes. 
                    If it was someone do they need to be contacted or can you really just fix it quickly and tell them later. Is it a point to show the error they did or make yourself look good. It's an out fixing the problem.
                    Sure you can't spend time following everyone around and fixing their problems but collaboration and being receptive of positive criticism or changes to something you feel you own or built.
                    Try not to take thing personal. Walking on egg shells or avoiding the what you know will be a confrontation will only lead to the problem remaining and affecting things.
                    Not you job.
                    What is your job. Is it the function or list of responsibilities listed on the job description or is it only what was on your last review? Root of the job. Be a viable business. To succeed a viable business needs to deliver on the product of service there are selling. 
                    The customer doesn't or shouldn't know or care who supports the database an application they wish to use is, or who is monitoring the application processes is another person. They care they they can use the application securely and that it is available when they need to use it. 
                    If the DBA notices errors on an application but verifies the database is up and available do they just goto back to sleep or notify and punt the problem to someone else.
