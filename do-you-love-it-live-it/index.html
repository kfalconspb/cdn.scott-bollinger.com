Sure, with enough practice, I could play things and follow beginner sheet music, but there's a difference between playing every note and playing the music.</p><p>It's not like I don't love music. I'd just prefer listening to it, rather than playing. It wasn't my passion.</p><h3 id="what-do-you-want-to-be-when-you-grow-up"><strong>What do you want to be, when you grow up?</strong></h3><p>As life progressed from childhood into my teens the answer changed many times. Sometimes day to day.</p><p>Astronaut, Cowboy, Doctor, Computerist?</p><p>Give me a break, it was early 70's. Everything changed my 4th grade year. My first computer and endless hours typing in Basic programs from the back of a computer magazine, to have it do some momentary thing, but it was ME having it do it.</p><p>Computers were put on hold for a couple years at the beginning of high school because well, other things held my attention. When I picked up computers again circa x386, for me, the OS and hardware were more my focus, then wanting to program. Gone the way of that long abandoned musical career, programming certainly would have been a different career adventure had that continued to be my focus.</p><h3 id="focus"><strong>Focus</strong></h3><p>My focus professionally may have changed in IT over the years but it has always provided me constant enjoyment. I learned from each and every job or project.</p><p><strong><strong>Remember:</strong></strong> Just because you're good at something, doesn't mean you're passionate about it, or actually, even enjoy doing it!</p><p>Going with the whole knowledge gap analysis theme I'm in, gotta ask, do I actually still enjoy working in technology? If you were to talk to me for five minutes you know I'm still very passionate about it. Or at least have some passionate opinions about certain topics.</p><h3 id="a-job"><strong>A Job</strong></h3><p>There's also a difference between a job and a career. A job is something you do to pay for the stuff you like to do on the weekends. I love the tech industry. Always changing, forever troubleshooting, and constantly learning.</p><p>It's not all glamorous overnights in the data center. But when you step outside, after a dozen or so hours, and the glare forces your eyes shut, do you still think what a beautiful day?</p><p>If you're not having fun doing what you're doing, I urge you to find your passion. If another topic in IT interests you, learn it, study it! Who cares it's not what your 9-5 responsibilities are?</p><p>If you're passionate enough about a topic, the job will find you.</p><p>Life's too short.</p>
