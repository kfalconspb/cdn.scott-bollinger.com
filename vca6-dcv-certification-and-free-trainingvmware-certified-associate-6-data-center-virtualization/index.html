I have a great news for you. If you&#x27;ve looked into VMware certifications
previously, then you know there has always been a training course requirement.
The ~5k is a huge sum for small companies or those self funding to pay for
training.

Bigger News!
There is no course requirements for the new associate level certifications as
there is with the professional level certifications.

If that was the only news it would great for those looking to get their foot in
the VMware door.

But wait ther" />
