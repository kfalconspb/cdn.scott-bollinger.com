In this video Bob gives his picks, and below are a few that stood out for me. </p><p>Improved Lifecycle management, simplify hardware firmware patching/configurations, as well as VMWare software upgrades. Nowhere to go but improvement from here in my opinion. VMWare patching has always seemed clunky, and disjointed to me. Yes, 6.x as an improvement over 5, but I'm hoping for a more streamlined, single paned process, this time.</p><p>vCenter profiles, vCenter servers can subscribe to configuration data from another vCenter server, and now have the ability to import and export vCenter configurations. </p><p>Content Library, checking in and out of templates, and version control. </p><p>Windows server failover clustering against VMDKs, this will enable the virtualization and removal of RDMs, and the complexity they brought with failover.</p><p>Identity Federations, the ability to move authentication to your enterprise Identity provider, enable MFA, for a more centralized user management.</p><p>vMotion, faster, with lower stun times, and the ability move an encrypted VM cross-vCenter with vMotion <strong>without</strong> decrypting.</p><p>Watch his video and enjoy. I can't wait to lab this stuff!</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[International Organization for Standardization (ISO)]]></title><description><![CDATA[The International Organization for Standardization "(ISO) is an independent, non-governmental international organization with a membership of 164 national standards bodies...]]></description><link>https://scott-bollinger.com/international-org-std-iso/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5db42e430ec6cc5199d37eb2</guid><category><![CDATA[Security]]></category><category><![CDATA[General]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Scott Bollinger / @kfalconspb]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 25 Oct 2019 16:00:00 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="https://scott-bollinger.com/content/images/2019/10/global.jpg" medium="image"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><img src="https://scott-bollinger.com/content/images/2019/10/global.jpg" alt="International Organization for Standardization (ISO)"><p>If you've worked in technology, for any length of time, you've probably heard of ISO. It may had been in class, a book, or when working with a particular standard defined in your area of technology. I had as well, but nothing beyond the obvious of, they do standards in multiple counties. Usually it was the standard itself, that was my focus. This time I wanted to take a look.</p>
<p>The International Organization for Standardization &quot;(ISO) is an independent, non-governmental international organization with a membership of 164 national standards bodies...bringing together experts to share knowledge and develop voluntary, consensus-based, market relevant International Standards.&quot; <a href="https://www.iso.org/home.html">Ref https://www.iso.org/home.html</a></p>
<p>Begun operations 1947 and based out of Geneva, Switzerland. Knowing the acronym for the name would be different for the different languages, &quot;the founders decided to give it the short form ISO. ISO is derived from the Greek isos, meaning equal. Whatever the country, whatever the language, we are always ISO.&quot; <a href="https://www.iso.org/about-us.html">Ref https://www.iso.org/about-us.html</a></p>
<p>Standards &quot;include almost every industry, from technology, to food safety, to agriculture and healthcare.&quot; <a href="https://www.iso.org/home.html">Ref https://www.iso.org/home.html</a></p>

Though the Mac version does let you import and export, there was no way to import and export from the iPad or iPhone, that I can find.</p><p>Give it a try, next time you're looking for an RDP app!</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Create VMware ESXi USB Install Media]]></title><description><![CDATA[Download the ESXi ISO from the VMware Download Website.

There are reasons to change it as well.</p><p>A couple of those reasons are:</p><ul><li>Blend in - If all the devices on the network are Apple MAC addresses , an attackers machine with another vendor will standout.</li><li>Masquerade - Pretending to be an device already approved to be on the network, such as in a MAC filtered wireless lan.</li></ul><p>The BIA option, seems interesting as it was unknown to me previously.
