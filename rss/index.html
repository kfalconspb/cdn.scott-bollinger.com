It may had been in class, a book, or when working with a particular standard defined in your area of technology. I had as well, but nothing beyond the obvious of, they do standards in multiple counties. Usually it was the standard itself, that was my focus. This time I wanted to take a look.</p>
<p>The International Organization for Standardization &quot;(ISO) is an independent, non-governmental international organization with a membership of 164 national standards bodies...bringing together experts to share knowledge and develop voluntary, consensus-based, market relevant International Standards.&quot; <a href="https://www.iso.org/home.html">Ref https://www.iso.org/home.html</a></p>
<p>Begun operations 1947 and based out of Geneva, Switzerland. Knowing the acronym for the name would be different for the different languages, &quot;the founders decided to give it the short form ISO. ISO is derived from the Greek isos, meaning equal. Whatever the country, whatever the language, we are always ISO.&quot; <a href="https://www.iso.org/about-us.html">Ref https://www.iso.org/about-us.html</a></p>
<p>Standards &quot;include almost every industry, from technology, to food safety, to agriculture and healthcare.&quot; <a href="https://www.iso.org/home.html">Ref https://www.iso.org/home.html</a></p>
