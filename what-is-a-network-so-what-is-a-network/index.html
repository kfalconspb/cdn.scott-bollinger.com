This could be your telephone, cable, or satellite provider. They in turn connect to other networks.</p><p>So when you type in <a href="https://www.google.com/">www.google.com</a> in your browser your device is connecting to your home or other network. Which is connected to an ISP that is connected to a connection of networks until you finally arrive on the network connecting to Google.</p><h3 id="a-network"><strong>A Network</strong></h3><p>So, in short, a network is collection paths interconnecting devices allowing them to communicate.</p><p>They can be connected together in a wide variety of ways. Wire cables, wireless, microwave, infrared, etc.</p><p>They can communicate over common protocols. A protocol is just an agreed upon way they will communicate. TCPIP, IPX/SPX, AppleTalk, etc. TCPIP is what most everything today runs on.</p><p>This was my attempt at simplifying, what a network is.</p>
