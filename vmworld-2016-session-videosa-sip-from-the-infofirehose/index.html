The training and networking opportunities at events such as VMworld really needs to be experienced to be believed. If the networking is the gravy then the meat of the conference is the keynote announcements, pan els, and breakout session presentations.</p><h3 id="so-good-news-this-year-thanks-to-vmware-"><strong><strong>So good news this year, thanks to VMware.</strong></strong></h3><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://scott-bollinger.com/img/vmworld2016vids.png" class="kg-image" alt="VMware VMWorld Breakout Session Videos"></figure><p>Those not able enough to justify the expense of attending or maybe virtualization is not your main focus, now have the opportunity to view and study, up to date training and presentations.</p><p>As someone that has attended VMworld, there are too many sessions to see everything while at the conference. There is just not enough time in the day.</p><p>Time to look up those sessions that were missed, full, or looked interesting. Also time to review the sessions I attended and see what I missed or may not have heard while I grabbed a brownie, a soda, or had to pee. Yeah I said it, two hours in the morning for getting seating and keynote is a little long. #JustSayin' #BeingReal</p><p>Also I hope VMware will consider in the future to make the videos available on their YouTube channel instead of having to use their website's player. Some videos just need to be speed up. This also opens up the videos to those that may need the automated closed captioning. Just think about it VMware.</p><p>So loose yourself, feed your brain, and pause when you need to.</p><h3 id="update-with-scripts-20160909-"><strong><strong>Update with scripts 20160909:</strong></strong></h3><p>Thank you William Lam <a href="https://twitter.com/lama/">@lamw</a> for posting the direct download links for VMworld 2016 sessions.
