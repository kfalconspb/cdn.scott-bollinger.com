The first time I saw a vMotion between two hosts it was amazing. Not only doing
it without down time, but while the server was up and functional!

Now we have not only vMotion cross vSwitch but cross vCenter and even Long
Distance. If I was told 25 years ago that I&#x27;d be able to move a server while it
was up from one data center to another in another State or Country, it would
have seemed impossible and far fetched.
