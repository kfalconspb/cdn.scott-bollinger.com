The first year, I also had the opportunity to come out a couple days early and attend <a href="https://twitter.com/BsidesSF">@BsidesSF</a> <a href="https://bsidessf.org/">https://bsidessf.org</a>. I fully recommend <a href="https://twitter.com/SecurityBsides">@SecurityBSides</a> <a href="https://securitybsides.org/">SecurityBSides.org</a> conferences. Though they differ in size, they've been in my experience very inclusive and welcoming to the new as well as those more experienced.</p><p>If you only have one conference budgeted, and wish to see all the vendors in one place, then the RSA Conference is for you. Both expo halls are filled and every security vendor you can think of has a booth. As with any vendor, sorting through the smoke and mirrors takes time, the upside is, you can review offerings, and talk to the engineers in rapid succession.</p><p>If you end up attending, or are already scheduled to attend, look for me. I'd look to meet you!</p>
